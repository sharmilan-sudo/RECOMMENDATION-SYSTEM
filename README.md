### **Task Description: Recommendation System Using Collaborative Filtering**

The objective of this task is to design and implement a **recommendation system** using **collaborative filtering or matrix factorization techniques**. Recommendation systems are widely used to suggest relevant items to users by analyzing patterns in user behavior, such as ratings or interactions, rather than relying on item content.

In this task, a dataset containing **user–item interaction data** (for example, user ratings for products, movies, or services) is used. The initial step involves organizing the data into a structured format that represents the relationship between users and items. This data is then transformed into a **user–item matrix**, which serves as the foundation for collaborative filtering.

To generate recommendations, **matrix factorization techniques** such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are applied. Matrix factorization reduces the high-dimensional user–item matrix into lower-dimensional latent factors that capture hidden relationships between users and items. These latent features help predict how a user might rate an unseen item.

The trained model is used to **predict missing ratings** and generate personalized recommendations for each user. Items with the highest predicted ratings are recommended as the most relevant suggestions.

To evaluate the performance of the recommendation system, appropriate **evaluation metrics** such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are used. These metrics measure how closely the predicted ratings match the actual ratings in the test dataset, providing insight into the accuracy of the model.

This task demonstrates the complete workflow of building a recommendation system, including data preparation, model development, recommendation generation, and performance evaluation. It highlights the effectiveness of collaborative filtering techniques in delivering personalized recommendations and fulfills the internship requirement of producing a functional recommendation system with evaluation results.
